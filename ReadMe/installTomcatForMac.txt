Step 1: Download Tomcat
Download Jakarta Tomcat from the Tomcat home page, and get the binary version - I_downloaded jakarta-tomcat-5.0.27.tar.gz.
Extract the files (unless your browser automatically extracts them).
Navigate (using the Finder) to Macintosh HD > Library.
If there is not already a folder in Macintosh HD > Library called Tomcat, then create one.
If there is already a Tomcat folder (presumably from an out-of-date installation), delete all the files already in that folder.
Step 2: Extract tomcat archive
Copy all the unstuffed files from the jakarta-tomcat-5.0.27.tar.gz download and put all the files into the Tomcat folder.
I just named it Tomcat as it saves some typing in the Terminal (smile)
So the directory structure becomes:
Macintosh HD > Library > Tomcat > <extracted files>
Step 3: Configure tomcat-users.xml
Open the /Library/Tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml file with a plain text editor. The default Tomcat installation only has the basic roles and users set up.
What is configured as default is:
 <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
 <tomcat-users>
   <role rolename="tomcat"/>
   <role rolename="role1"/>
   <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat"/>
   <user username="both" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat,role1"/>
   <user username="role1" password="tomcat" roles="role1"/>
 </tomcat-users>
An example of what it should look like follows:
 <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
 <tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="tomcat"/>
  <role rolename="role1"/>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat,admin,manager"/>
  <user username="both" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat,role1"/>
  <user username="role1" password="tomcat" roles="role1"/>
 </tomcat-users>
In this case a role, a user and password have been set up with the name tomcat. You can change this later.
Step 4: Start Tomcat
To start Tomcat, open a shell command prompt (using, for instance, the Terminal application).
The path to Tomcat via the Finder is Macintosh HD > Library > Tomcat.
But to get to that directory using the Terminal, type in:
cd /Library/Tomcat/bin
Do an ls - you should see a file called startup.sh.
Any file in this directory ending in .sh can be executed in the terminal by putting a period and a slash before the file name (eg: startup.sh). The following example executes the tomcat startup script:
./startup.sh && tail -f ../logs/catalina.out
Terminal should display four lines looking something like this:
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /library/tomcat
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /library/tomcat
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /library/tomcat/temp
Using JAVA_HOME:       /Library/Java/Home
Users-Computer:/library/tomcat/bin user$ 
There are some notes and a couple of Preference Panes for automating the starting and stopping of Tomcat. After trying them all on five different computers - this is the simplest!
Step 5: Test installation Open a browser window, and enter http://127.0.0.1:8080 - the default Tomcat page should open.
If you click the Tomcat Administrator or Tomcat Manager links in the upper left hand of the default Tomcat page, you will be asked for a user name and password.
As mentioned above, use tomcat for the user name, and tomcat for the password.
